Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript, APIs and OpenAI.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code.

We use `async/await` when fetching data from an API.

We use OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model.

We use `const` and `let` for variables and template literals for string formatting and DOM insertion.
